# INFORUM – The INsecure FORUM

Welcome to this third mandatory assignment of INF226.
In this assignment you will be improving the security
of a program called Inforum – a very simple discussion
forum in the form of a web-application.

Inforum has been especially crafted to contain a number
of security flaws. You can imagine that it has been
programmed by a less competent collegue, and that after
numerous securiy incidents, your organisation has decided
that you – a competent security professional – should take
some time to secure the app.

For your convenience, the task is separated into specific
exercises or tasks. These task might have been the result
of a security analysis – like the one you had in the
second assignment. If you discover any security issues
beyond these tasks, you can make a note of them at the
end of this report.

For each task, you should make a short note how you solved
it – ideally with a reference to the relevant git-commits you
have made.

## Evaluation

This assigment is mandatory for the course, and counts 10%
of your final grade. The assigment is graded 0–10 points,
where you must get a minimum of 3 points in order to pass
the assignment.

## Handing in the assignment

Once you are done, you submit the assignment on
[`mitt.uib.no`](https://mitt.uib.no/) as a link to your
repository. This means you should not commit to the
repository after the deadline has passed.

## Updates

Most likely the source code of the project will be updated
while you are working on it. Therefore, it will be part of
your assignment to merge any new commits into your own branch.

## Improvements?

Have you found a non-security related bug – maybe you have
an idea for a new feature you want to add to the forum?
Feel free to open an issue on the project GitLab page.
The best way is to make a separate git branch for these
changes, which do not contain your sulutions 

(This is ofcourse completely volountary – and not a graded
part of the assignment)
